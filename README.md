# 🤖 AI Learns to Jump!

This project is a simple experiment where an AI learns to jump over obstacles using a neural network built with NumPy. The learning is dynamic — the AI adjusts its learning rate based on how well it's performing.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The AI observes obstacle distances.
- It decides whether to jump using a small neural network.
- If it succeeds, it learns from it.
- If it fails, it learns even harder.
- The learning rate adapts automatically — and you can also tweak it live using the arrow keys:
  - → to increase learning rate
  - ← to decrease learning rate

## 🎮 Controls

- Watch the AI play by itself.
- Use the keyboard to adjust its learning speed.

## ⚙️ Built With

- Python
- NumPy
- Pygame

## 🚀 Goal

Teach a simple AI to jump over obstacles — and understand how dynamic learning rate affects performance.
